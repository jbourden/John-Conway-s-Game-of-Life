INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Open up your command line / terminal.

2) To compile the project, type the following:

javac Life.java

3) The next step will involve passing through parameters to Life. 

The first parameter is the grid size. This size will be multiplied by a factor of 4. For example, if you put in 50 for your grid size, it would produce a 200 x 200 pixel window.

The second parameter is the number of iterations. This can be any number greater than 0.

The third parameter is the game mode. Type R for a Random game. Type G or L for a Glider Gun game.

An example of a full command would look like this...

java Life 100 500 R

Another example would be...

java Life 150 300 G
